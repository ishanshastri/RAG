Working in the travel industry, I always received amazing feedback about the airline, and they have steadily held their position as being well-respected in the industry. I always like to share our travel experiences, so I thought I’d do a review on Singapore Airlines economy class.\\nFind budget Singapore Airlines fares here.\\n\\nSingapore Airlines economy class review\\nWhen we were searching for flights for our trip to Europe, the decision over which airline to choose came down to the best price and the most efficient airline to get to our destination. We didn’t have much time In Europe, so we wanted to maximise our time on the ground and minimise the travel time. Singapore Airlines won out on price and in efficiency in getting us to our destination.\\nI think it’s always tough to go into any situation with high expectations. Even on our ride to the airport our driver was chatting to us about how amazing Singapore Airlines is and how she had never heard a bad word about them. It was therefore difficult not to expect excellence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSingapore Airlines economy class extra legroom seats\\nCheck-in was seamless, as was boarding and our flight was on time. We had booked extra legroom seats which cost around $150 extra per person per sector. So Sydney to Singapore cost $150 per person to have the extra legroom, Singapore to Paris, Rome to Singapore and so on. It was an expense on top of an already exorbitantly high airfare, and keep in mind, Singapore Airlines provided us with the best value for money with our airfares. Hubby thought we could do without it on the shorter flights but I was determined to arrive in Europe in the best shape possible and on our return we knew we would hit the ground running. So, we paid for the extra legroom and I think it was money well spent. It was great to be able to stretch out, we could get up and down as often as we liked, without squeezing past people, and there’s just something less claustrophobic about having space around you.\\nOur seats were in the exit row on most of our flights, which is not available to people travelling with a disability as you are supposed to be able to assist in an emergency if necessary. I’m not sure that everyone sitting in those sits would help, let alone could help, but perhaps that’s me being cynical.\\nOur extra legroom seats Singapore to Paris – non-exit seats\\nThere are however, some extra legroom seats that are not classified as exit row, so if you are booking with an airline, and can afford them, it might be worth checking out that option. Flying Singapore to Paris we had the extra legroom seats pictured above which are non-exit row seats and they offered a lovely amount of space to stretch out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the return to Australia, Hubby and Amelia booked the row behind the exit row which only offers one seat (next to the window) which has the extra legroom. You can see in the picture above and the one below what that seat is like.\\n\\nThis may be of assistance if you only have one family member that really needs the space. For example, if we were travelling with Braeden, we’d put him in that extra legroom seat by the window and the rest of us could manage having a seat in front of us. At least we’d know his restlessness would be less likely to bother people and he’d have more space to stretch out.\\nA380 aircraft have an accessible bathroom which is about double the size of a standard airline bathroom\\nBooking the extra legroom seats did mean we were located near the toilets. This wasn’t a problem for us and from my bird’s eye position, I can tell you that Singapore Airlines cabin crew are the most attentive I’ve seen in regards to hygiene. The toilets were cleaned so regularly and thoroughly it was seriously impressive. On the A380 flights there was a larger bathroom for use for people with a disability.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBook Singapore Airlines flights here.\\nSingapore Airlines economy class catering & entertainment\\nThe entertainment options were fine. It wasn’t a mind-blowing selection but it did keep us all sufficiently entertained. I found a much wider selection when I flew with Delta Airlines to the US last year. I did find myself getting back into Grey’s Anatomy after dropping it many moons ago. Wow, I’ve missed a lot.\\n\\nSingapore Airlines economy class food was good Sydney to Singapore and Singapore to Rome. \\nI wasn’t a fan of the options on my return flights. I found the meals on the way home were heavily salted and absolutely swimming in soy sauce. I like soy but in measured amounts. I also missed getting eggs for breakfast.\\n\\nAmelia was flying home a few weeks after us so I suggested she order vegetarian meals and she reported that they were good. In retrospect I’d order vegetarian meals in the future too if I was flying with Singapore Airlines.\\nOn our flights from Australia to Europe we received a lovely Connoisseur ice cream as a snack. I may have slept through any snacks on the return leg as I didn’t see any come around. I did notice other passengers asking for snacks overnight and they received a variety of salted snacks including Doritos and chips. I couldn’t see any snack bar on the plane for help-yourself-snacking.\\nAmenities kits are not provided but toothbrushes and toothpaste is available in the bathrooms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore pictures and reviews of Singapore airlines here.\\nDisability assistance\\xa0\\nBraeden wasn’t travelling with us this trip, but I watched as passengers who needed mobility assistance were helped. As usual, passengers with a disability were assisted to board the aircraft first, and were required to leave the aircraft last. If you are booking a trip with Singapore Airlines, or just considering them as an airline, you may like to start your research on their Disability Assistance page.\\n\\nIt was great to see Auslan on the inflight safety briefing video. After learning a lot about Auslan while Amelia was studying, I agreed with her that the person doing Auslan in the video should be wearing black, or there should be a dark background behind her to make it clearer.\\nWe found the flight attendants to be polite and accommodating. Singapore Airlines economy class was good. It didn’t live up to the high expectations I had and the food on my return journey was a let down but perhaps I’d heard too much hype. The extra legroom was well worth the money and I’d book those seats again if I was travelling on a long-haul flight.\\nMost importantly, all our fights arrived on time at our destinations, even when the flights were delayed leaving from certain cities they made up the time in the air. Hubby’s lost luggage could have been dealt with in a better manner and of course that caused a negative feeling at the end of his trip (you can catch up on the saga of the lost luggage here). Both Amelia and I had no problem with our luggage arriving.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m keen to hear if you’ve travelled Singapore Airlines how you found them. I’m especially keen to hear about the disability assistance services.\\nYou may also like to read\\nTips for making air travel more comfortable – wheelchair accessible tips\\nChangi Airport accessibility\\nMy travel packing essentials\\nReview of Delta Airlines Premium Select\\nAir New Zealand accessible travel review\\n\\xa0\\nFind more Singapore Airlines fares and options here.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n31 thoughts on “Singapore Airlines economy class review”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nPeda Richey \\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFebruary 13, 2023 at 12:12 am\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nHi There. I have traveled al around the world with Singapore airlines. And I would not travel with anybody else. I disagree with you with the food and entertainment. The food and entertainment is the best I have experienced. I staff on Singapore airlines are so polite and helpful.

My outgoing connecting flight with Singapore airline was delayed by more than 4 hours. Flight out the food was good.  First part of connecting flight back to UK was with Scoot airline like flying with Ryan Air. Flight back to the UK on Singapore airline the food not good. As it was a night time flight only really saw the flight attendants in first 1-2 hours and last 1-2 hours of 13 hour flight .Needed  more drink and snacks. Landing in the UK excellent.\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nRichard Baxter \\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFebruary 13, 2023 at 12:21 pm\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nHi I first travelled with Singapore way back in 1982. And again in 88.  That year also travelled with Cathay who were not as good as Singapore, who by then I thought were fantastic.\\nI have only recently started totravel again with Thai who in 2018 were excellent, even travelled with Bangkok Airlines who on a short flight were also great, even providing a meal for a 90 minute flight.\\nI think some Asian airlines have learnt lessons from Singapore Airlines.\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nJulie \\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFebruary 14, 2023 at 2:08 am\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThanks Richard.\\nIt’s great to hear of your experiences with the various airlines.

In fact in the review I comment that the food on our return was not to my liking and the entertainment was good but I’ve had better on another airline. \\nThe only experience I can write about is my own. The review is a reflection of our experience so I’m sorry if you read that as being unbalanced. I publish every comment received whether they agree or disagree with my review in a hope that our readers do get a balanced opinion, and that now includes yours. \\nJulie\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nKenneth Waldron \\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMarch 17, 2023 at 8:01 pm\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI booked and had similar same seats on the30 ex Adelaide. Leg room was a benefit but that was the only plus. These seats did not have a window, baggage was allowed to be left on the floor next to these seats, the person with extra leg room in the seat behind used the space to move to and from the toilets. There was also often a queue waiting for the toilet standing right in front of the seats. This was very annoying on the evening flight. Whilst the crew and everything else was good I will never pay extra again for these seats on the 350 aircraft which is all Singapore Airlines fly ex Adelaide.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSarjit singh \\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAugust 24, 2023 at 7:15 pm\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nHi i like to complement sq flight 923 from surabaya  ,juanda Airport to Singapore.

In 2018, I flew Singapore Airlines to Copenhagen and it was by far the best experience I have had on long haul flight. Flew both ways on a Boeing 777, but despite being a smaller plane than the A380 or 747, the legroom was amazing. I flew economy and did not pay for extra leg room – glad I didn’t. It would have been wasted of money. The food was excellent and the cabin crew were exceptional. SA will always be my first choice of airline.\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nJulie \\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFebruary 14, 2023 at 2:07 am\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThat’s great to hear.

I saved my money to splurge for the first time in my life on a business seat. It was rubbish!!! The in flight service was terrible. As a vegan, the crew had no idea what foods I was able to eat. The vegan menu provided me so few calories that I had Á hyperglycaemic episode from Singapore to Frankfurt and had to drink about a litre of Pepsi to stay alive!!! No paper menu; no snacks offered except tiny packs of salted nuts, no one to help explain the complicated tech system on how to scan your phone to find out info; no one assisted with reclining seats because unlike other airlines nothing about the seating is straightforward. Tried to complain to the airline but it was impossible even with Kris flyer status.\\nI would not recommend this airline for food, inflight service, or value for money to any future traveller.\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nJulie \\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFebruary 14, 2023 at 2:10 am\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nHi Linda\\nI can’t imagine how disappointed you must have been to save your money to splurge on business class only to have a poor experience.

Can’t fault the staff and totally agree about the cleanliness of the plane. I was asked if I would like an upgrade to the aisle seat in the exit row so that another passenger could sit with her husband. Due to the configuration of the aisles I found that EVERY person who passed my seat, bumped my screen, feet or head. Advise to avoid that seat.

Somehow, it is not the best when you get the same food on all legs, to and fro, but taste wise, I cannot complain. On the whole even though for my big size I find the tray space is narrow, I find flying with them quite pleasurable. I have only travelled Singapore Thail and Malay Southern China I can’t compare with any other airplanes, but I find Thai and Singapore the best. Thank you ❤️.. I am travelling in coming May too. This time we booked through Web because it was cheaperthan close to 3000 I have been paying since after covid, but I couldn’t find an optionn to book a wheelchair.

He sat in the single extra legroom seat and said he had a fixed arm rest as he had his entertainment monitor swing up from the fixed arm. He said the two people beside him had their monitors in the seat back so he’s fairly sure that their arm rest would have been able to be raised. We all travelled home from Europe at different times so we didn’t sit together to know definitely but from what he describes I think you’ll have one arm rest between you and your toddler you’ll be able to raise.\\nYou could call the airline but I imagine it would be a long time on hold. \\nBest of luck\\nJulie\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nChelsea \\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMarch 23, 2023 at 11:19 pm\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThank you so much for that Julie!
